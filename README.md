# Predicting-Car-Prices-Machine-Learning-Project
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict car prices based on
various features such as manufacturer, mileage, engine capacity, and more. The
dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables,
and standardize features. Two regression models, namely Linear Regression and
Random Forest Regression, are trained on the processed data to predict car
prices.
The performance of each model is evaluated using the R-squared metric. This
project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and
model building for predictive analytics tasks in the automotive domain
